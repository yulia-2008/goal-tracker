need to be done:
- rename TimeRange (variable and button)
- keyboard layout
- text input is still in focus after selecting other butons
- if not all fields are filled and Set Goal pressed - what should happen?
- Add new Goal button text - make bigger
- If date is selected in dayPicker and it is opened again, the selected days are not selected anymore but the button holds dates.
- Need no deadlin option in a datePicker
