need to be done:
- rename TimeRange (variable and button)
- keyboard layout
- text input is still in focus after selecting other butons
- if not all fields are filled and Set Goal pressed - what should happen?
- Add new Goal button text - make bigger
- Home Screen and LifeArea has different "Add Button" position???? Flex parametr is the same.

- working in a Goal Screen. FlatList inside of ScrollView is not allowed, had errors. Need to be fixed.
