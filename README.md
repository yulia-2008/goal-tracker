need to be done:
- rename TimeRange (variable and button)
- keyboard layout
- text input is still in focus after selecting other butons
- if not all fields are filled and Set Goal pressed - what should happen?
- Add new Goal button text - make bigger
- "no deadline" option in a datePicker - how this data stored when updating GoalsData
- Home Screen and LifeArea has different "Add Button" position???? Flex parametr is the same.
